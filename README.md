- **ReactJS:** The website is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for efficient development and easy integration of the reusable components mentioned earlier.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Beautyness uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to style its components and layout. Tailwind CSS makes it simple to create a consistent and visually appealing design while also enabling rapid development through its utility classes.

- **Vite:** The project is set up with Vite, a fast and efficient build tool for JavaScript applications. Vite's development server and build process ensure quick development cycles and optimal production builds.
